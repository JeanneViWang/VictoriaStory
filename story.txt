It's a snowy day. It's actually have been snowing for 3 days, and the snow seems to never stop. 

A little girl is walking in the street.

A black van without license plate stopped beside her. 
Two men in black came out and dragged her to the van.
Door closed and the van left the scene.

As the door shut she realized she recognized one of the guys. It was her brother Tom and his friend Kevin. It turns out they were playing a prank on her and she didn't like it.
