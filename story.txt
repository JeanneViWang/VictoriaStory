It's a snowy day. It's actually have been snowing for 3 days, and the snow seems to never stop. 

A little girl is walking in the street.

A black van without license plate stopped beside her. 
Two men in black came out and dragged her to the van.
Door closed and the van left the scene.

As the door shut she realized she recognized one of the guys. It was her brother Tom and his friend Kevin. It turns out they were playing a prank on her and she didn't like it.

The little girl thought to herself: it's time to let Tom learn something. So she pretended that she didn't revoganize any of the boys. Instead, she secretly pressed the button on her watch to call the police. The police came really fast and arrested the two boys. No matter how the boys trying to clarify that it's only a prank, the little girl continued crying. In the end, the girls parents came and comforted the girl. The naughty boys learnt that a prank is no longer funny if you crossed the line.
